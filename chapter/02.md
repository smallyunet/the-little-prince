## Chapter 2

And so I lived alone, with no one really to talk to, until a breakdown in the Saharan desert, six years ago. Something had failed in my engine. As I had neither passengers nor a mechanic, I was getting ready to attempt, all on my own, some difficult repairs.

It was a matter of life or death. I had scarcely enough drinking
water to last eight days.



That first night I went to sleep on the sand a thousand miles from any human dwelling. I was much more alone than a person shipwrecked on a raft in the middle of the ocean. So you can imagine my surprise when, at sunrise, a strange little voice woke me. It said:

“Please… draw me a sheep!”

“Huh!”

“Draw me a sheep…”





I leapt to my feet as if struck by lightning. I rubbed my eyes thoroughly. I had a good look. And I saw an altogether extraordinary little fellow who was watching me with a solemn expression. Here is the best portrait that I was able to make of him, later on. But, of course, my drawing is much less beautiful than the model. It’s not my fault. Grown-ups had discouraged me from my artistic career when I was six, and I hadn’t learnt to draw anything other than open or closed boa constrictors.


So I was watching this apparition with wide, astonished eyes. Don’t forget that I was a thousand miles from any human dwelling. Yet my little fellow looked neither lost, nor dying of weariness, dying of hunger, dying of thirst or dying of fear. He seemed nothing like a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human dwelling. When at last I managed to speak, I asked him: 

“But… what are you doing out here?”

And he said again, very softly, in all seriousness:

“Please… draw me a sheep…”

When a mystery is too overwhelming, you dare not disobey. As absurd as it seemed to me a thousand miles from any human dwelling and in mortal danger, I reached into my pocket for a piece of paper and a pen. Then I remembered that I had studied mostly geography, history, mathematics and grammar, and I said to the little fellow (in something of a bad mood) that I didn’t know how to draw. He replied:

“It doesn’t matter. Draw me a sheep.”

As I had never drawn a sheep, I redid, for his benefit, one of
the only two drawings I was capable of. That of the closed boa
constrictor. And I was astounded to hear the little man reply:

“No! No! I don’t want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is dangerous, and an elephant is very bulky. My home’s very small. I need a sheep. Draw me a sheep.”


So I drew.

He looked carefully, then said:

“No! That one’s already very ill. Do another.”

I drew: 

My friend smiled kindly, indulgently:

“See for yourself… that’s not a sheep, it’s a ram. It’s got horns…”

So I redid my drawing again:

But it was rejected, like the previous ones:

“That one’s too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time.”

Finally, my patience at an end, as I was in a hurry to start dismantling my engine, I scribbled this drawing:

And I exclaimed:

“That’s the crate. The sheep you want is inside.”


But I was very surprised to see my young critic’s face light up:

“That’s exactly how I wanted it! Do you think this sheep needs a lot of grass?”

“Why?”

“Because my place is very small…”

“I’m sure it’ll be enough. I’ve given you a very small sheep.”

He bent his head over the drawing:

“Not that small… Look! It’s fallen asleep…”

And so it was that I made the acquaintance of the little prince.
