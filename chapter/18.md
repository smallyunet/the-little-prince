## Chapter 18


The little prince crossed the desert and met with only one flower. It was a flower with three petals, a flower of no account at all.

"Good morning," said the little prince.

"Good morning," said the flower.

"Where are the men?" the little prince asked, politely.

The flower had once seen a caravan passing.

"Men?" she echoed. "I think there are six or seven of them in existence. I saw them, several years ago. But one never knows where to find them. The wind blows them away. They have no roots, and that makes their life very difficult."

"Goodbye," said the little prince.

"Goodbye," said the flower.

<p>花说，早上好。</p>

<p>小王子问，哪儿有人？</p>

<p>花曾经见过一次路过的商队，回答说，六七年前我曾经看到过他们，不过我不知道哪里能找到他们，他们跟随着风一起走远了。他们没有根，他们的生活也很艰难。</p>
