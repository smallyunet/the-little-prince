Antoine de Saint-Exupery, who was a French author, journalist and pilot wrote The Little Prince in 1943, one year before his death. 

Antoine de Saint-Exupery 是一位法国作家，同时也是记者、飞行员，他在 1943 年写下《小王子》，那是他去世的前一年。

The Little Prince appears to be a simple children’s tale, some would say that it is actually a profound and deeply moving tale, written in riddles and laced with philosophy and poetic metaphor. 

《小王子》作为简单的童话故事问世，很多人却说《小王子》是一个意义深远和令人感动的故事，有很多迷一样隐喻，并且富有诗意以及哲学意味。

## To Leon Werth

I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grown−up. I have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown−up understands everything, even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown−up grew. All grown−ups were once children−− although few of them remember it. And so I correct my dedication:
